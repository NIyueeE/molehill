## Where this stands

### 1.0.0: the KCP carrier becomes `mhd` (branch `feat/v1.0.0`, from tag v0.11.2)

The carrier is being rebuilt on its own code rather than another project's
name, in six gated phases. Landed so far, each green through the fast gates
and the full serial suite:

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `52cb6e6` | rename the carrier to `mhd`: engine module, adapter, feature, runtime enum, stats switch, status counters; the wire dialect moves 5.2 → **6.0** because the registration carries the carrier name |
| `9b26073` | the pool holds `Arc<dyn PoolLane>` instead of a concrete yamux handle, so a second carrier can hand it lanes |
| `28686e5` | GSO: a batch of equal-size datagrams leaves as one `sendmsg` with `UDP_SEGMENT`; the kernel segments, the NIC emits |
| `1291c42` | GRO: the receive batch holds one region per run and splits it on the segment size the kernel reports |
| `3de5953` | path MTU from the kernel's own `EMSGSIZE`: halve to the engine floor; no ICMP dependency |
| `3dde835` | one listener socket per core under `SO_REUSEPORT`, and the recorded decision that pacing stays in userspace |
| `1f191ee` | stage a session's batch for the datagram it runs at (45 KiB, not 256 KiB), with the bound pinned by a test |

**The P2 gate is unmeasured, and that is the one open question.** The bench
model refuses to start here: its topology is three network namespaces and two
TUN devices, so it needs root, and this container has no working `sudo`
(`sudo: unable to send audit message`). `cpu_s_per_gbit` for mhd against TCP
is therefore **not** known, and no claim about the carrier's cost is made
anywhere. The run that would answer it is
`MOLEHILL_DATA_CARRIER=tcp|mhd sudo -n just bench --profile screen --aa`,
interleaved on one host; until it exists, phases 3-5 proceed on the plan's
reasoning and not on evidence.

**Fixed in the new engine (P3a).** The connection now re-sends what the recovery
declares lost. The defect was in the send buffer, not in the recovery rules: an
acknowledgement advanced the base to the highest offset acknowledged instead of
over the contiguous run that starts at it, so acking packets 1..5 walked the base
past the hole at 0 and the bytes behind it were gone before the rewind arrived.
The buffer now keeps the acknowledged ranges and advances only over the run that
starts at its base, which is what makes a hole survive until it is re-sent. Two
tests that stated the intent now pass rather than being ignored:
a_dropped_datagram_is_recovered_without_losing_a_stream and
a_lost_datagram_holds_one_stream_and_not_the_other.

Two defects were found by the phases themselves, both worth remembering:
losing the receive region on the first `EAGAIN` (a batch that can never receive
again) and parking an oversize datagram instead of shrinking (a retry loop that
never terminates).


- **The release sweep is done and the PR is ready (2026-10-19).** The
  published run is the second one: 19:19–21:04 UTC (6265.5 s, 90 samples) at
  `69e8bd9` with `tree_clean: true`, host `86ab43dd4d4010c3` (the same
  identity as the v0.11.1 record; CPU probe 417.3 MiB/s, loopback
  21.06 Gbit/s), fingerprint `257343fa3fd158d3`. The first run
  (16:46–18:29, at `04f5c5d`) was discarded when CI found the no-multiplex
  forwarding defect: fixing it changed `src/`, so the record had to be
  re-measured rather than name a revision whose code no longer matched.
  `just bench gate` passed the absolute half without a baseline on both; the
  v0.11.1 record is **refused** as a baseline because the engine hash changed
  with the flat Noise configs (`c4d337fbd8ee2adc` → `deec5d29798c5a68`).
  Every arm carried the ramp's full eight streams (a floor) and no arm wedged.
  The clean-stage bulk reading is 8.641 Gbit/s on L4 (clean#2 7.066) and 5.811
  on L3; the previous record's 8.907 is **not** a comparison — the method
  changed, and striping now starts at one channel and grows only on
  backpressure. The L4 clean p99 is 30.8 ms here against 8.8 ms in the
  discarded run with the same host identity and calibration; both runs pass
  the gate's 50 ms SLO, and the difference is recorded as run-to-run variance,
  not a claim about the fix (its cfg changes add nothing to the default
  build's data path). Charts and README are refreshed from the record.
- **The interop matrix was fixed and is green (2026-10-19).** v0.11.2 moved the
  Noise tables, and the matrix wrote one config for both binaries, so the
  released side refused the file before the wire was tested. Each side now
  gets its own schema, and the released side is configured with KK (a
  supported v0.11.1 setting) so the hello's version check is reachable: 3/3
  pass. Two observations from the same session: the default v0.11.1 client
  (NK) is refused cleanly, while a v0.11.1 client with its own static key (KK)
  leaves both sides waiting (ESTAB, no bytes) instead of closing — reproduced,
  not root-caused; and the L3 harness passed 13/15 on its first run at
  `04f5c5d` (the two lane-lending arms failed on the known ~5 s stall) and
  15/15 on a second run.
- **CI caught the no-multiplex forwarding defect before merge (2026-10-19).**
  The `noise` integration leg (`server,client,noise,hot-reload`, which is
  exactly the `embedded` set) registered its services but every visitor hung:
  v5.2 made the striped command the only TCP forward, and the client refused it
  without `multiplex`. The stripe registry and its release path are
  transport-agnostic and are compiled in every client build now; a group of one
  runs over the direct channel the server opened. The same CI run also caught
  the featureless compile (client/server-gated constants in `stripe`,
  client-gated socket2 imports in the keepalive helper, a wrong parameter name
  in `transport/tcp.rs`) and two Noise-key tests that need the `noise`
  feature. `just check`, the feature powerset, both lib legs and the no-mux
  hot-reload suite pass.
- **The branch history is squashed for review (2026-10-19).** 24 commits became
  eight. The configuration/runtime-policy consolidation is one commit because
  the intermediate trees' bench configs were unreadable by their own binary
  (the original gate passed on a stale release build), so they could not each
  satisfy `bench-selfcheck`; the other groups are striping, the L3 step, the
  status schema, the deployment docs, the cycle opener, the interop fix and the
  no-multiplex forwarding fix. The squash preserved the tree, and every commit
  passes its own gate.
- **The 0.11.2 configuration migration is in (2026-10-19).** The branch
  replaces the per-service pool/tunnel/transport model with one session pool,
  one L3 lane budget, four flat KK Noise layers, dynamic
  striping/worker/heartbeat/valve defaults and wire v5.2. `just check` is
  green. Open threads: manual acceptance of the full §4 table and the old-key
  refusals, and the tag decision.
- **Linux L3 takes the same device/address step macOS and Windows own
  (2026-10-19).** A Linux transparent service now creates its persistent TUN
  device when one is missing and, on the client, assigns each claimed address
  that is not already on it — exactly what macOS already does on its own (the
  device and the claimed addresses) and what the Windows server does for its
  adapter. No config key gates it: an existing device is used as it is (create
  it first to choose its MTU), and an address already assigned is left alone,
  so a second claim or a restart does not bounce a live interface. Routes,
  policy routing and forwarding stay the operator's on all three, which is the
  symmetry the maintainer asked for. An earlier version automated the routing
  half too (mark, policy rules, sysctls, `accept_local`); it was proven in a
  three-namespace topology and then withdrawn by decision. Two facts survive
  it: recipe B needs `net.ipv4.conf.<tun>.accept_local=1` (the manual recipe
  now documents it), and a device the daemon creates appears at
  startup/registration, so per-device sysctls must come from
  `net.ipv4.conf.default.*` before the start and routes that name the device
  must be applied after it appears — the ordering macOS and Windows recipes
  already have. The narrowed mode was re-proven on this host in the same
  topology, both recipes: the daemons created the devices and the client's
  address, the operator's steps followed, and the visitor was echoed through
  the claim. The default L3 harness ran again at `04f5c5d` on 2026-10-19:
  13/15 on the first run (the lending arms stalled) and 15/15 on a second; the
  device/address arms passed on both. A local variant that skipped the
  harness's own device setup created both
  devices and the client's address and passed every device-path arm, but its
  two lane-lending arms failed: the 16-flow arm stalled for about five seconds
  when a lane was lent, a window the default load finishes before. That is a
  lane-allocator observation, not root-caused here and not part of the device
  step.
- **Striped-group release and the striping signal were corrected (2026-10-19).**
  Two defects from the migration's striping commit. A group that ended by
  aborting a direction left its reader tasks parked on the mux streams, so the
  client's stream leases never came back — the saturated-pool test only passed
  because it restarted the client — and the target grew off *gather* latency, a
  proxy on the pairing path rather than path backpressure. The readers are now
  owned by the receive direction and aborted with it; the server releases an
  abandoned group on the client (`ReleaseStripedGroup`, tag 8 of the still
  unreleased v5.2 dialect, so it is extended in place); the client tombstones a
  released group so a stripe still in flight is dropped; and growth follows a
  group's own parked send direction (at least 250 ms, one step per 500 ms,
  capped at `MAX_STRIPES` 64). `a_saturated_pool_still_serves_the_next_visitor`
  now asserts the pool gets its streams back within 15 s and no longer restarts
  the client. No throughput claim is made from this: the sweep has to measure
  it, and it re-baselines anyway.
- **Platform cfg and CI verification were hardened after review (2026-10-18).**
  `build.rs` now emits the `mh_*` platform aliases (`mh_linux`, `mh_macos`,
  `mh_windows`, `mh_l3`, `mh_l3_client`, `mh_l3_server`) and makes
  `native_target` OS-aware; L3 code uses those aliases instead of repeated
  `target_os`/feature combinations. `transparent` now implies `carrier` (the
  KCP/TCP choice, fallback and lane budget) and `noise` (its control channel),
  not `multiplex`; `multiplex` includes `carrier`, so the L3 client works
  without yamux and the config capability, runtime gate and test build agree.
  CI builds every target with
  `--target` and runs both macOS architectures on native runners (`macos-26`,
  `macos-26-intel`); the test-build target list gained `macos-x64`. This is not
  a wire or config-schema change; the default release set is unchanged.
- **The v0.11.1 harness change is in, and the sweep that follows is a
  re-baseline.** The bench model moved from `benches/scripts/bench/` to the
  top-level `bench/` uv project (one console script, `ruff` + `pyright`
  configured in `bench/pyproject.toml`, adapters in
  `bench/src/bench/targets/`). The engine hash now covers the method modules,
  the adapters and the probes — not the CLI, the plotter or the utilities — so
  v0.11.1's fingerprints differ from v0.11.0's by construction. The sweep
  ran on 2026-10-18 and the gate passed **without** a baseline; the new file
  is the next baseline, and no cross-version method comparison is presented
  ([docs/release.md](docs/release.md), "Benchmarks: per-tag ritual").
  The refactor's decisions: one `ToolAdapter` contract starts the subject,
  the control and every peer (`bench/src/bench/targets/`), so a new peer is an
  adapter plus a `PEERS` row and the runner has no tool branches; the engine
  hash names the method modules, `targets/**` and `probes/**` explicitly and
  excludes `cli.py`, `plot.py`, `paths.py` and `utils/**`; pyright runs in
  `standard` mode at zero errors with the adapter files opted into `strict`
  (whole-model strict was measured at 4,811 errors, a separate annotation
  project). `--peer-dir` makes the peer cache configurable on `run` and
  `doctor`, and `provenance.binaries` still records only the subject binary.
- **v0.11.0 is released, and the release record is closed.** The tag was
  deleted and re-pushed once (the first push pointed at `9ad3362`, whose
  release run failed); the released tag is the re-push. The preparation
  record — four tag attempts, the squashes, the wedge gate and the offload fix
  — is in the archive.
- **v0.11.1 is the first `bench`-model baseline.** The v0.11.0 sweep predates
  the model (only the two *soak* files remain), so v0.11.1 was gated on the
  absolute checks — coverage, the endpoint invariant, the SLO, drift, wedge and
  the capacity ramp — and its record is what future releases compare against:
  `benches/records/results-bench-v0.11.1.json`, 90 samples, fingerprint
  `f246a9601305cc75`. The measured revision is `0b56438`; the preservation
  branch was retired with the other non-`main` branches on 2026-10-19, so the
  hash is recorded here — a fresh clone cannot resolve it.
- **An L3 claim's lane budget is a live tuning surface, and its default is
  two.** The throughput ceiling is a serialized per-packet path, so a claim's
  throughput follows its lanes; four lanes buys 121 % of bulk throughput and
  costs the interactive stream its SLO headroom, so the default is the largest
  value that keeps both. The measurement, the cost in connections and the
  upgrade path are owned by [`DEFAULT_CLAIM_LANES`](src/common/constants.rs)
  and the configuration page; the full record — including the first version of
  that constant, which chose four from the bulk-only table — is in the archive.
- **Lending is the one mechanism this leaves unmeasured.** `lend` is on by
  default and moves an *idle* lane to the claim with more flows than lanes, and
  the new default now gives it slack to move. Its own benefit is still
  unestablished: the 7-second `bulk-n` cell cannot show it (lending needs ticks
  and confirmations, and each `dev` round restarts the processes), and the one
  run that did show it converging was voided by the shaper bug recorded in the
  archive. A long-hold scenario is what would settle it; the arms already exist
  (`l3-budget10-lending` against `l3-budget10-nolend`).
- **The repository state**: v0.11.1 is released and the tag names `4874f05`,
  the `main` tip at tag time; `main` carries `version = "0.11.1"`. The
  `## [0.11.1] - 2026-10-17` section is dated, and the 0.11.2 work sits under
  `[Unreleased]`. `v0.11.0` names `f3295e8`. `feat/v0.11.2` carries
  `version = "0.11.2"` and is squashed to eight commits plus the benchmark
  record; the PR is open and no tag exists. The measured v0.11.2 revision is
  `69e8bd9` (`tree_clean` true; the record commit is docs/assets only, so the
  tag review's drift check still holds). The previous cycle's branches
  (`feat/v0.11.1-builds`, `bench/v0.11.1-measured` and the four local
  `backup/*`) were retired on 2026-10-19. The measured v0.11.1 revision is
  `0b56438`, recorded here and in the results file's `meta.provenance`; the
  tag review's drift check applies wherever that commit is reachable, so for
  this record a fresh clone prints a note instead of the verdict.
  The v0.11.1 tag was re-created on `4874f05` after a transient 0.11.2 bump was
  reset off `main`; that commit's tree is identical to the first tagged commit,
  so the rebuilt archives and image describe the same code. A re-tag re-runs
  the whole workflow, whose `crates.io` job then fails: `molehill-rathole
  0.11.1` is already published and cannot be uploaded twice. The workflow has
  no skip guard for that case, so a re-tag leaves the run red after the
  release, artifacts and GHCR image are updated.
- **Only docs and assets may follow a sweep.** `githooks/pre-tag` reads the
  results file's recorded revision and fails the tag if `src/`, `tests/`,
  `Cargo.*`, `build.rs` or the bench model's own code changed since — the
  changelog date and the README numbers may, code may not (AGENTS.md §10,
  "prove provenance").
- **The release path builds and smoke-tests; it no longer re-runs the suite.**
  `release.yml` builds every artifact and runs `--help` on the native ones
  the runner can execute; CI owns the test suite (it now also tests
  x86_64-musl natively), and a tag-only push runs the release review without
  the local heavy chain. The
  v0.11.0 release blockers were platform flakes in the release matrix, not
  product failures.

## Open threads for the next cycle

- **Decision (2026-10-19): one top-level tunnel pool in both modes; the
  per-service/per-claim model is rejected, not renamed.** There is exactly one
  tunnel pool per control session (one per data endpoint), and every service
  draws its channels from it; `[client.services.<name>].tunnels` is removed.
  The same shape holds for L3: `[transparent.data].tunnels` is the client's one
  carrier-connection budget, and `[transparent.claims.*].tunnels` is removed —
  that key is a dead field today (the parser accepts it, the lowering never
  reads it; verified 2026-10-19 with a budget of 4 and two claims writing 8 and
  6: the client started and ran on 2 lanes each). The current per-service
  implementation is wrong; 0.11.2 replaces it with the model below.
  - **Defaults are the measured optima, not the cheapest value.**
    - **L4: `tunnels = 4`** — the shipped knee, and now the *total* width of
      one pool rather than four per service: yamux spreads streams over it (up
      to 56 per tunnel), and the 0.10 A/B found 8 does not move a mixed
      workload's throughput while costing 42-61 % of interactive p99 at 15+
      streams. One pool serves about 224 concurrent streams; a deployment
      above that raises the one key.
    - **L3: `tunnels = 2 × claims`** — the measured knee (1 lane 2.351 Gbit/s,
      2 lanes 3.283, 4 lanes 5.191 but p99 271 ms from three streams). Two per
      claim also leaves the spare lane `lend` needs: at one per claim the
      allocator can never lend, because a donor must have more than its last
      lane. The public `DEFAULT_CLAIM_LANES` goes; the derivation lives
      privately in the L3 module.
    - An explicit `tunnels` is always the **total**: L4 clamps to `1..=64`; L3
      must cover the claim count and is capped at 1024, with integer division
      leaving the remainder unallocated (write a multiple of the claim count).
  - `[client.data].shared_pool` stops being a switch: one pool is the only
    shape, so the key is removed (or kept as a no-op for one release — to be
    decided).
  - The proposed `default_tunnels` name no longer describes the key. With no
    per-service inheritance it is the pool's width, not a default; the final
    name is open (`tunnels` today).
  - The UDP-derived floor becomes the deepest demand across every UDP service
    that draws on the pool, and validation and runtime must read the same
    source; the first-service-width defect below disappears with the model.
  - Per-service `remote_addr` and `transport` still fragment the L4 pool today
    (the key is session + data endpoint, and the transport is the first
    service's), so the model needs a rule for them: refuse the override, or
    move both to the client-wide block. L3's per-claim `remote_addr` is fine —
    there is no shared pool, only a total count.
  - Pinned vs elastic stays open. "On-demand" today means channel placement on
    a pinned pool; the 0.10 elastic pool (grow on load, shrink on idle) was
    replaced in 0.11 for capacity predictability (CHANGELOG, "The tunnel pool
    is pinned"). If 0.11.2 also restores growth, that is a second decision.
  - The 0.10 measurement (shared p99 8.15 ms against per-service 5.00 at 19/20
    steps) is why the per-service default shipped. This decision overrides it,
    and the single-pool model needs its own measurement before any claim; `4`
    and `2 × claims` are the best-evidenced defaults until that sweep.
  Implemented in 0.11.2: `[client.data].tunnels` is the session's total
  width and `[transparent.data].tunnels` the L3 lane budget. This entry stays
  as the decision record.
- **Operator decision (2026-10-19): the production pair stays on forwarding
  (L4) until L3 is stable; L3 remains the target.** The maintainer's own
  deployment (ssh/http/https, Minecraft UDP, Mumble TCP+UDP) keeps the
  forwarding model for now and moves to claims when the gaps below close — the
  visitor's real source address is what a claim buys, and it is worth waiting
  for. The 0.11.1 client migration that decision needs is schema only:
  `default_mode`, `default_carrier`, `[client.data.tcp]`, `[client.data.kcp]`
  and the per-service `carrier` are gone, the carrier is chosen at runtime
  (KCP, TCP fallback), and a host that both forwards and claims runs two
  processes. No code change is implied by this decision.
- **Recipe B's single-IP client side is a documentation gap (found
  2026-10-19).** With the claim on the server's own public address, the client
  assigns that address to its TUN, so the kernel treats it as local and the
  client's control channel to `<server-ip>:2333` loops back to itself.
  `docs/deployment.md` says the client side is "recipe A's, unchanged"; that is
  not sufficient. Verified in a network namespace: demote the `local` table
  (`ip rule add pref 200 lookup local; ip rule del pref 0`) and add
  `ip rule add pref 100 iif lo to <server-ip> lookup main` — locally generated
  traffic then leaves via the gateway while inbound visitor packets are still
  delivered locally. Both language pages need the extra steps, and a single-IP
  acceptance case would keep it from regressing. A documentation and
  acceptance gap, not a data-path defect.
- **Naming decision pending: `[client.data].tunnels` vs `default_tunnels`
  (raised 2026-10-19).** The key is the client-wide default for every service
  that does not write its own `[client.services.<name>].tunnels`, which is
  exactly what `default_token`, `default_remote_addr` and
  `default_retry_interval` signal, so the unprefixed name reads as an
  inconsistency. It is `tunnels` today because the per-service key has the same
  name (the `default_` family is used where the child key is named
  differently), and because 0.10 deliberately replaced `default_count` with
  `tunnels` when the pool became pinned — the old "initial size" reading no
  longer applied. Options: a sentence in the configuration page naming it the
  default for services (cheap, preferred while the line is stabilizing), or a
  rename to `default_tunnels` through the removed-keys migration (parser
  refusal, the `githooks/check-docs` removed-key table, both language pages, an
  invalid-config test and an `[Unreleased]` entry). A rename leaves the
  per-service `tunnels` and `[transparent.data].tunnels` (a lane budget) alone.
  Superseded (2026-10-19) by the one-pool decision above: with no per-service
  inheritance the key is the pool's width, not a default, so `default_tunnels`
  no longer describes it. The final name is open.
- **`shared_pool`'s width is decided by whichever service activates first
  (verified 2026-10-19).** With `[client.data].shared_pool = true`, the session
  pool is created by the first service to become active and uses *that
  service's* `tunnels` (its override, else `[client.data].tunnels`), so a
  per-service override can size the shared pool. The comment on
  `ClientConfig::tunnels` says the client-wide count is the one a shared pool
  uses, and the config validation checks only that count against the UDP
  floor, so the runtime and the stated rule disagree. Reproduced with two
  services (`tunnels = 16` and `4`, client-wide `8`): four runs logged
  `tunnels=16` twice and `tunnels=4` twice, tracking activation order. Not a
  deployment issue for the pair above (it does not set `shared_pool`), but a
  defect to fix before the key's semantics are frozen: either honour the
  client-wide count in shared mode, or validate the per-service overrides and
  document the first-service rule. No fix made. Subsumed by the one-pool
  decision above (2026-10-19): the model removes the per-service pool and the
  switch, so the defect goes away with the replacement rather than with a local
  fix.
- **The 32-bit embedded targets are compile-checked, not test-run.**
  `5e585b7` closed the aarch64 half — the two full-set musl targets build in
  CI (x86_64 on `ubuntu-latest`, aarch64 natively on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`) and a
  native aarch64-musl test job runs the release's test command on every PR —
  and added a cross compile job for the three 32-bit `embedded` targets. A
  qemu test run for those remains the optional next step. The closure record
  is in the archive.
- **A config the product refuses was a config every check accepted
  (2026-10-13).** The mandatory-Noise rule lived in `run_instance`, so every
  parser-based check was blind: 24 documented examples, every bench arm's
  configs, both L3-acceptance ends and all three interop cases refused to start
  while `just check` stayed green. Two guards now exist (the doc-example test
  and `from_str`; `just bench selfcheck` loads each arm's config). **The general
  hole is open**: a rule enforced at runtime rather than parse time has no
  check that names it; start the next one in `from_str`.
- **Build times were decomposed (2026-10-13, 20 cores, rustc 1.99); the
  workspace split is measured and declined for now.** The inner loop is fast
  (check 1.3 s, clippy pass 1 9 s, the lib test binary 4.5 s); the felt
  slowness is the release build (71 s, user ≈ wall) under fat LTO. LTO-off is
  61 s and thin LTO 68 s, so fat LTO costs ~10 s; a split buys only finer
  check/test incrementality (1–4.5 s). Revisit when check times reach minutes
  or an architectural boundary needs enforcing; the dependency direction is
  already clean (`mux` ← `transport` ← `core` ← `main`, `mux` a
  zero-reverse-dep leaf). The benches-only classification now covers both hooks
  (`f9c0187`).
- **The safe-`nix` replacement for `udp_batch` is in.** The shipped variant
  rebuilds `MultiHeaders` per call (it is `!Send`), so the module has no
  `unsafe` left; a stored-header + `SmallVec` variant kept three `Send`/`Sync`
  proofs and measured the same. On the KCP `l4` path
  (`just bench --profile screen --arms l4 --ab-arm l4`, four runs) the
  raw-FFI baseline measured 1.566-1.578 s/Gbit against 1.590-1.602 for the nix
  variants: ~1.5-1.9 % higher CPU, consistently in the same direction. That is
  inside `cpu_s_per_gbit`'s 15 % materiality floor (no claim), so the safety
  win was accepted.
- **`quinn-udp` is not a drop-in replacement for this batching.** Its
  `poll_send` takes one `Transmit`, and GSO requires contiguous, equal-sized
  segments; KCP's batch is a mix of `Staged` and `Split` spans, so using it
  would mean copying every datagram or paying one syscall per datagram. Its
  `poll_recv` enables GRO, which returns coalesced datagrams that KCP would
  have to split by `stride` before its per-datagram accounting. That is a
  transport redesign with its own A/B, not a wrapper swap, and the `nix`
  wrapper already removed the local unsafe.
- **`tun-rs` is accepted for the cross-platform L3 cycle.** The earlier trial
  measured 1.1969 s/Gbit for the audited ioctl attach against 1.2045 for
  `tun-rs` (~0.6 % slower, inside the 15 % floor), and adds 29 crates and ~300
  lockfile lines; the cross-platform requirement is what changed the decision,
  not the cost. The three audited ioctls are gone, so production `unsafe` is
  now zero; `tun-rs`'s syscalls sit behind the dependency audit/deny gates.
  Vendoring only the used Linux subset was still rejected: 4,588 lines and 41
  `unsafe` blocks against the 299-line wrapper.
- **Protocol v5.1, and why it is a patch-release wire break.** The version is
  now `major.minor` (two bytes) and `StartForwardTransparent` carries the frame
  format (`Ip` or `Vnet`). A Linux pair negotiates `Vnet` and keeps the GSO
  fast path; any pair with a plain-IP device negotiates `Ip`, and the Linux
  side converts in `src/transparent/frame.rs`. v5.0 is refused on the
  connection it happens on. AGENTS.md §5 was updated: `5.1` is a dialect
  label, not a SemVer-compatible minor.
- **Both Linux L3 acceptance modes pass (2026-10-17).** `just l3-accept`
  (Vnet) and the same harness with `MOLEHILL_L3_WIRE=ip` (plain-IP wire) both
  returned PASS on every verdict, including transparency, no server-side
  flow state, bulk/MTU, 2,000 small round trips and 16 flows. The plain-IP
  run's bulk arm carried 314 packets at a mean 2,237 B/packet instead of 52
  super-frames at 7,614 B, which is the expected shape of the conversion
  path. The screen A/B for `tun-rs` on Linux has not been re-run since the
  cross-platform changes; it is deferred for v0.11.1 by the operator decision
  below, so this release makes no tun-rs A/B claim.
- **IPv6 is in v0.11.1, not deferred.** The v5.1 frame carries opaque IP
  packets, so this needed no wire bump: the work is the IPv6 parser (base
  header, common extension-chain walk with a header-count ceiling, fragment
  header, TCP/UDP ports, ICMPv6/ESP address-only, jumbograms rejected), the
  `gso_split` family argument, macOS `/128` assignment, Linux `ip -6`
  rules/routes and forwarding check, the Windows `/128` recipe, and tests.
  `just l3-accept-ipv6` passes on the `Vnet` wire and with
  `MOLEHILL_L3_WIRE=ip`: a visitor on an IPv6 path reaches a client-owned
  `/128`, the backend sees the visitor's IPv6 address, the server holds no
  socket, and a 60 KiB stream round-trips byte-exactly. The macOS/Windows
  IPv6 recipes still need real-host validation, like their IPv4 counterparts;
  that validation is deferred for v0.11.1 (see the deferral note below).
- **Windows L3 client is out of scope for v0.11.1.** Windows has no built-in
  source-address policy routing; a native client would need a WFP callout or
  WinDivert-class redirector, with a driver and its own security review. The
  config refuses it at parse time and names WSL2. macOS uses a pf
  `route-to` rule; the recipe still needs validation on a real Mac, and the
  exact syntax may depend on the utun's point-to-point peer. Windows **server**
  support is implemented (Wintun + `wintun.dll` + route/forwarding recipe) but
  also needs a real-host acceptance run; that run is deferred for v0.11.1 (see
  the deferral note below).
- **Deferred by operator decision for v0.11.1 (2026-10-18): macOS/Windows L3
  real-host acceptance, the `tun-rs` screen A/B and the lending measurement.**
  Linux `l3-accept` on both wire formats remains the only end-to-end L3
  evidence; the macOS pf/utun and Windows Wintun/routing recipes are documented
  but unvalidated on hardware. No tun-rs performance claim or lending claim is
  made from this release. These are accepted gaps, not blockers.
- **The five test-only env-mutation `unsafe` blocks can be wrapped, but the
  trade was declined.** `temp-env` 0.3.6 (`async_closure`) makes
  `set_var`/`remove_var` scoped and safe at the call site; a worktree
  conversion of the three multiplex tests and the pool handover test passed
  the full suites. It needs a dev-dependency (`futures` via `async_closure`)
  and re-resolves unrelated `windows-sys` entries in `Cargo.lock`, so it is
  not worth changing a sanctioned test-only waiver for it.
- **Privileged ports** are documented as *not* implemented (the whitelist admits
  any port it contains; the OS decides whether the bind succeeds). Enforcing
  `<1024` would be a behaviour decision for the human.
- **Carried over**: an HTTP API for configuration (hot reload is files-only),
  replacing the python bench project with `cargo-script` once it is stable,
  and QUIC (implemented and measured, parked in the `archive/transport-test`
  tag; revisit only for a UDP-only path or multi-stream loss isolation).
- **Repository settings are a human's to make**: branch protection for `main`
  and the release secrets. Nothing in this repository can enable them; they are
  the last release item outside the tree.

## Environment notes (this host, re-checked 2026-10-01)

- **Verify `iperf3` before a long run** (`command -v iperf3`). It is installed
  at runtime rather than baked into the image, so a container restart drops it:
  measured on 2026-10-01, when a restart (new hostname, uptime reset) left the
  binary gone and a sweep produced an artifact of typed failures in 14 seconds.
  The bench fails cleanly — every test records `No such file or directory:
  'iperf3'` and the gate refuses the file — but it looks like a finished
  artifact until someone reads it.
- **`/tmp` is periodically wiped.** Keep `--out` and logs under `~/tmp` or the
  repo. The bench model's own work directories (`~/tmp/bench-*`) are normal
  residue and are never deleted by the harness.
- **`timeout N` orphans the run.** The wrapper signals `uv run`, not the python
  child, which keeps executing and holds the bench lock.
- **Peers are cached** in `~/tmp/bench-peers` and the interop binary in
  `~/tmp/interop`, so `just bench` and `just interop` normally need no network.
  `just bench peers fetch` re-resolves each peer to the **latest GitHub
  release** and re-downloads when the cached version is behind; the resolved
  versions are recorded in the results meta beside the numbers.
- **`sudo` works without a password** and `tc`/`ip` are present, so the shaped
  stages and the MTU classes run here.
- **This host is `3f8b4508ab91`**: 20 cores, 23 GB RAM, kernel
  `6.12.0-160000.38-default`. `/etc/machine-id` is **absent**, so the bench
  model's `host_id` hashes `cpu model + core count` only
  (`host_id_basis.machine_id: false`) — *not* the hostname. The container's
  hostname changes between sessions without moving `host_id`, which is the
  point: the comparable runs in this cycle's files share `host_id
  d764f9da9c7e5b2a`, and a file *without* a `host_id`
  (`results-soak-v0.9.0.json`, `98c48ea3fa68`) falls back to the hostname, so
  the gate refuses it.
- **`iperf3` is version-boundary-sensitive.** The carrier/KCP numbers of this
  cycle were measured across an `iperf3` reinstall (now 3.18); a version can
  change the UDP summary fields the model reads, so re-measure the baseline in
  the same session whenever the pair matters. The model should record the
  version with the run.
- **A baseline-less run is the norm here**: the gate's own self-check
  (completeness, endpoint invariant, absolute SLO) is what a fresh sweep is
  gated on, because every stored baseline either has no `host_id` or predates
  the current method. The v0.9.0 file is still compared where the method keys
  agree, and the gate names what it could not verify rather than assuming it.

## Archive

Everything this cycle closed is in [HANDOFF-archive.md](HANDOFF-archive.md),
with a contents list at the top and the detailed index further down: the
v0.11.0 release preparation (squashes, the wedge gate, the release audit, the
offload fix, the sweep record), the L3 cycle's decisions and investigation
records, the v0.10.0 cycle, the incidents and the superseded sweeps. The
records that predate the 2026-09-28 freeze were archived into git history
earlier and are indexed there too (`git show f2156de^:HANDOFF.md`).

The rule that keeps the split honest: **a record in the archive says what the
branch's authors believed at the time, and no number in it may be quoted as a
measurement of the current code, compared against a Soak result, or used to
gate anything.** The live numbers are
[the release sweep record](benches/records/results-bench-v0.11.0.json), whose
method's home is [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md).
