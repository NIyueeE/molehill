## Where this stands

- **Platform cfg and CI verification were hardened after review (2026-10-18).**
  `build.rs` now emits the `mh_*` platform aliases (`mh_linux`, `mh_macos`,
  `mh_windows`, `mh_l3`, `mh_l3_client`, `mh_l3_server`) and makes
  `native_target` OS-aware; L3 code uses those aliases instead of repeated
  `target_os`/feature combinations. `transparent` now implies `carrier` (the
  KCP/TCP choice, fallback and lane budget) and `noise` (its control channel),
  not `multiplex`; `multiplex` includes `carrier`, so the L3 client works
  without yamux and the config capability, runtime gate and test build agree.
  CI builds every target with
  `--target` and runs both macOS architectures on native runners (`macos-26`,
  `macos-26-intel`); the test-build target list gained `macos-x64`. This is not
  a wire or config-schema change; the default release set is unchanged.
- **The v0.11.1 harness change is in, and the sweep that follows is a
  re-baseline.** The bench model moved from `benches/scripts/bench/` to the
  top-level `bench/` uv project (one console script, `ruff` + `pyright`
  configured in `bench/pyproject.toml`, adapters in
  `bench/src/bench/targets/`). The engine hash now covers the method modules,
  the adapters and the probes — not the CLI, the plotter or the utilities — so
  v0.11.1's fingerprints differ from v0.11.0's by construction. The sweep
  ran on 2026-10-18 and the gate passed **without** a baseline; the new file
  is the next baseline, and no cross-version method comparison is presented
  ([docs/release.md](docs/release.md), "Benchmarks: per-tag ritual").
  The refactor's decisions: one `ToolAdapter` contract starts the subject,
  the control and every peer (`bench/src/bench/targets/`), so a new peer is an
  adapter plus a `PEERS` row and the runner has no tool branches; the engine
  hash names the method modules, `targets/**` and `probes/**` explicitly and
  excludes `cli.py`, `plot.py`, `paths.py` and `utils/**`; pyright runs in
  `standard` mode at zero errors with the adapter files opted into `strict`
  (whole-model strict was measured at 4,811 errors, a separate annotation
  project). `--peer-dir` makes the peer cache configurable on `run` and
  `doctor`, and `provenance.binaries` still records only the subject binary.
- **v0.11.0 is released, and the release record is closed.** The tag was
  deleted and re-pushed once (the first push pointed at `9ad3362`, whose
  release run failed); the released tag is the re-push. The preparation
  record — four tag attempts, the squashes, the wedge gate and the offload fix
  — is in the archive.
- **v0.11.1 is the first `bench`-model baseline.** The v0.11.0 sweep predates
  the model (only the two *soak* files remain), so v0.11.1 was gated on the
  absolute checks — coverage, the endpoint invariant, the SLO, drift, wedge and
  the capacity ramp — and its record is what future releases compare against:
  `benches/records/results-bench-v0.11.1.json`, 90 samples, fingerprint
  `f246a9601305cc75`. The measured revision is `0b56438`, preserved as
  `bench/v0.11.1-measured` after the history compression.
- **An L3 claim's lane budget is a live tuning surface, and its default is
  two.** The throughput ceiling is a serialized per-packet path, so a claim's
  throughput follows its lanes; four lanes buys 121 % of bulk throughput and
  costs the interactive stream its SLO headroom, so the default is the largest
  value that keeps both. The measurement, the cost in connections and the
  upgrade path are owned by [`DEFAULT_CLAIM_LANES`](src/common/constants.rs)
  and the configuration page; the full record — including the first version of
  that constant, which chose four from the bulk-only table — is in the archive.
- **Lending is the one mechanism this leaves unmeasured.** `lend` is on by
  default and moves an *idle* lane to the claim with more flows than lanes, and
  the new default now gives it slack to move. Its own benefit is still
  unestablished: the 7-second `bulk-n` cell cannot show it (lending needs ticks
  and confirmations, and each `dev` round restarts the processes), and the one
  run that did show it converging was voided by the shaper bug recorded in the
  archive. A long-hold scenario is what would settle it; the arms already exist
  (`l3-budget10-lending` against `l3-budget10-nolend`).
- **The repository state**: v0.11.1 is released and the tag names `4874f05`,
  the `main` tip at tag time; `main` carries `version = "0.11.1"`;
  `CHANGELOG.md` keeps the dated `## [0.11.1] - 2026-10-17` section and an empty
  `[Unreleased]`. `v0.11.0` names `f3295e8`. The measured v0.11.1 revision is
  `0b56438`, preserved as `bench/v0.11.1-measured`. The tag review checks that
  no measured code changed between that revision and the tagged commit.
  The v0.11.1 tag was re-created on `4874f05` after a transient 0.11.2 bump was
  reset off `main`; that commit's tree is identical to the first tagged commit,
  so the rebuilt archives and image describe the same code. A re-tag re-runs
  the whole workflow, whose `crates.io` job then fails: `molehill-rathole
  0.11.1` is already published and cannot be uploaded twice. The workflow has
  no skip guard for that case, so a re-tag leaves the run red after the
  release, artifacts and GHCR image are updated.
- **Only docs and assets may follow a sweep.** `githooks/pre-tag` reads the
  results file's recorded revision and fails the tag if `src/`, `tests/`,
  `Cargo.*`, `build.rs` or the bench model's own code changed since — the
  changelog date and the README numbers may, code may not (AGENTS.md §10,
  "prove provenance").
- **The release path builds and smoke-tests; it no longer re-runs the suite.**
  `release.yml` builds every artifact and runs `--help` on the native ones
  the runner can execute; CI owns the test suite (it now also tests
  x86_64-musl natively), and a tag-only push runs the release review without
  the local heavy chain. The
  v0.11.0 release blockers were platform flakes in the release matrix, not
  product failures.

## Open threads for the next cycle

- **The 32-bit embedded targets are compile-checked, not test-run.**
  `5e585b7` closed the aarch64 half — the two full-set musl targets build in
  CI (x86_64 on `ubuntu-latest`, aarch64 natively on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`) and a
  native aarch64-musl test job runs the release's test command on every PR —
  and added a cross compile job for the three 32-bit `embedded` targets. A
  qemu test run for those remains the optional next step. The closure record
  is in the archive.
- **A config the product refuses was a config every check accepted
  (2026-10-13).** The mandatory-Noise rule lived in `run_instance`, so every
  parser-based check was blind: 24 documented examples, every bench arm's
  configs, both L3-acceptance ends and all three interop cases refused to start
  while `just check` stayed green. Two guards now exist (the doc-example test
  and `from_str`; `just bench selfcheck` loads each arm's config). **The general
  hole is open**: a rule enforced at runtime rather than parse time has no
  check that names it; start the next one in `from_str`.
- **Build times were decomposed (2026-10-13, 20 cores, rustc 1.99); the
  workspace split is measured and declined for now.** The inner loop is fast
  (check 1.3 s, clippy pass 1 9 s, the lib test binary 4.5 s); the felt
  slowness is the release build (71 s, user ≈ wall) under fat LTO. LTO-off is
  61 s and thin LTO 68 s, so fat LTO costs ~10 s; a split buys only finer
  check/test incrementality (1–4.5 s). Revisit when check times reach minutes
  or an architectural boundary needs enforcing; the dependency direction is
  already clean (`mux` ← `transport` ← `core` ← `main`, `mux` a
  zero-reverse-dep leaf). The benches-only classification now covers both hooks
  (`f9c0187`).
- **The safe-`nix` replacement for `udp_batch` is in.** The shipped variant
  rebuilds `MultiHeaders` per call (it is `!Send`), so the module has no
  `unsafe` left; a stored-header + `SmallVec` variant kept three `Send`/`Sync`
  proofs and measured the same. On the KCP `l4` path
  (`just bench --profile screen --arms l4 --ab-arm l4`, four runs) the
  raw-FFI baseline measured 1.566-1.578 s/Gbit against 1.590-1.602 for the nix
  variants: ~1.5-1.9 % higher CPU, consistently in the same direction. That is
  inside `cpu_s_per_gbit`'s 15 % materiality floor (no claim), so the safety
  win was accepted.
- **`quinn-udp` is not a drop-in replacement for this batching.** Its
  `poll_send` takes one `Transmit`, and GSO requires contiguous, equal-sized
  segments; KCP's batch is a mix of `Staged` and `Split` spans, so using it
  would mean copying every datagram or paying one syscall per datagram. Its
  `poll_recv` enables GRO, which returns coalesced datagrams that KCP would
  have to split by `stride` before its per-datagram accounting. That is a
  transport redesign with its own A/B, not a wrapper swap, and the `nix`
  wrapper already removed the local unsafe.
- **`tun-rs` is accepted for the cross-platform L3 cycle.** The earlier trial
  measured 1.1969 s/Gbit for the audited ioctl attach against 1.2045 for
  `tun-rs` (~0.6 % slower, inside the 15 % floor), and adds 29 crates and ~300
  lockfile lines; the cross-platform requirement is what changed the decision,
  not the cost. The three audited ioctls are gone, so production `unsafe` is
  now zero; `tun-rs`'s syscalls sit behind the dependency audit/deny gates.
  Vendoring only the used Linux subset was still rejected: 4,588 lines and 41
  `unsafe` blocks against the 299-line wrapper.
- **Protocol v5.1, and why it is a patch-release wire break.** The version is
  now `major.minor` (two bytes) and `StartForwardTransparent` carries the frame
  format (`Ip` or `Vnet`). A Linux pair negotiates `Vnet` and keeps the GSO
  fast path; any pair with a plain-IP device negotiates `Ip`, and the Linux
  side converts in `src/transparent/frame.rs`. v5.0 is refused on the
  connection it happens on. AGENTS.md §5 was updated: `5.1` is a dialect
  label, not a SemVer-compatible minor.
- **Both Linux L3 acceptance modes pass (2026-10-17).** `just l3-accept`
  (Vnet) and the same harness with `MOLEHILL_L3_WIRE=ip` (plain-IP wire) both
  returned PASS on every verdict, including transparency, no server-side
  flow state, bulk/MTU, 2,000 small round trips and 16 flows. The plain-IP
  run's bulk arm carried 314 packets at a mean 2,237 B/packet instead of 52
  super-frames at 7,614 B, which is the expected shape of the conversion
  path. The screen A/B for `tun-rs` on Linux has not been re-run since the
  cross-platform changes; it is deferred for v0.11.1 by the operator decision
  below, so this release makes no tun-rs A/B claim.
- **IPv6 is in v0.11.1, not deferred.** The v5.1 frame carries opaque IP
  packets, so this needed no wire bump: the work is the IPv6 parser (base
  header, common extension-chain walk with a header-count ceiling, fragment
  header, TCP/UDP ports, ICMPv6/ESP address-only, jumbograms rejected), the
  `gso_split` family argument, macOS `/128` assignment, Linux `ip -6`
  rules/routes and forwarding check, the Windows `/128` recipe, and tests.
  `just l3-accept-ipv6` passes on the `Vnet` wire and with
  `MOLEHILL_L3_WIRE=ip`: a visitor on an IPv6 path reaches a client-owned
  `/128`, the backend sees the visitor's IPv6 address, the server holds no
  socket, and a 60 KiB stream round-trips byte-exactly. The macOS/Windows
  IPv6 recipes still need real-host validation, like their IPv4 counterparts;
  that validation is deferred for v0.11.1 (see the deferral note below).
- **Windows L3 client is out of scope for v0.11.1.** Windows has no built-in
  source-address policy routing; a native client would need a WFP callout or
  WinDivert-class redirector, with a driver and its own security review. The
  config refuses it at parse time and names WSL2. macOS uses a pf
  `route-to` rule; the recipe still needs validation on a real Mac, and the
  exact syntax may depend on the utun's point-to-point peer. Windows **server**
  support is implemented (Wintun + `wintun.dll` + route/forwarding recipe) but
  also needs a real-host acceptance run; that run is deferred for v0.11.1 (see
  the deferral note below).
- **Deferred by operator decision for v0.11.1 (2026-10-18): macOS/Windows L3
  real-host acceptance, the `tun-rs` screen A/B and the lending measurement.**
  Linux `l3-accept` on both wire formats remains the only end-to-end L3
  evidence; the macOS pf/utun and Windows Wintun/routing recipes are documented
  but unvalidated on hardware. No tun-rs performance claim or lending claim is
  made from this release. These are accepted gaps, not blockers.
- **The five test-only env-mutation `unsafe` blocks can be wrapped, but the
  trade was declined.** `temp-env` 0.3.6 (`async_closure`) makes
  `set_var`/`remove_var` scoped and safe at the call site; a worktree
  conversion of the three multiplex tests and the pool handover test passed
  the full suites. It needs a dev-dependency (`futures` via `async_closure`)
  and re-resolves unrelated `windows-sys` entries in `Cargo.lock`, so it is
  not worth changing a sanctioned test-only waiver for it.
- **Privileged ports** are documented as *not* implemented (the whitelist admits
  any port it contains; the OS decides whether the bind succeeds). Enforcing
  `<1024` would be a behaviour decision for the human.
- **Carried over**: an HTTP API for configuration (hot reload is files-only),
  replacing the python bench project with `cargo-script` once it is stable,
  and QUIC (implemented and measured, parked in the `archive/transport-test`
  tag; revisit only for a UDP-only path or multi-stream loss isolation).
- **Repository settings are a human's to make**: branch protection for `main`
  and the release secrets. Nothing in this repository can enable them; they are
  the last release item outside the tree.

## Environment notes (this host, re-checked 2026-10-01)

- **Verify `iperf3` before a long run** (`command -v iperf3`). It is installed
  at runtime rather than baked into the image, so a container restart drops it:
  measured on 2026-10-01, when a restart (new hostname, uptime reset) left the
  binary gone and a sweep produced an artifact of typed failures in 14 seconds.
  The bench fails cleanly — every test records `No such file or directory:
  'iperf3'` and the gate refuses the file — but it looks like a finished
  artifact until someone reads it.
- **`/tmp` is periodically wiped.** Keep `--out` and logs under `~/tmp` or the
  repo. The bench model's own work directories (`~/tmp/bench-*`) are normal
  residue and are never deleted by the harness.
- **`timeout N` orphans the run.** The wrapper signals `uv run`, not the python
  child, which keeps executing and holds the bench lock.
- **Peers are cached** in `~/tmp/bench-peers` and the interop binary in
  `~/tmp/interop`, so `just bench` and `just interop` normally need no network.
  `just bench peers fetch` re-resolves each peer to the **latest GitHub
  release** and re-downloads when the cached version is behind; the resolved
  versions are recorded in the results meta beside the numbers.
- **`sudo` works without a password** and `tc`/`ip` are present, so the shaped
  stages and the MTU classes run here.
- **This host is `3f8b4508ab91`**: 20 cores, 23 GB RAM, kernel
  `6.12.0-160000.38-default`. `/etc/machine-id` is **absent**, so the bench
  model's `host_id` hashes `cpu model + core count` only
  (`host_id_basis.machine_id: false`) — *not* the hostname. The container's
  hostname changes between sessions without moving `host_id`, which is the
  point: the comparable runs in this cycle's files share `host_id
  d764f9da9c7e5b2a`, and a file *without* a `host_id`
  (`results-soak-v0.9.0.json`, `98c48ea3fa68`) falls back to the hostname, so
  the gate refuses it.
- **`iperf3` is version-boundary-sensitive.** The carrier/KCP numbers of this
  cycle were measured across an `iperf3` reinstall (now 3.18); a version can
  change the UDP summary fields the model reads, so re-measure the baseline in
  the same session whenever the pair matters. The model should record the
  version with the run.
- **A baseline-less run is the norm here**: the gate's own self-check
  (completeness, endpoint invariant, absolute SLO) is what a fresh sweep is
  gated on, because every stored baseline either has no `host_id` or predates
  the current method. The v0.9.0 file is still compared where the method keys
  agree, and the gate names what it could not verify rather than assuming it.

## Archive

Everything this cycle closed is in [HANDOFF-archive.md](HANDOFF-archive.md),
with a contents list at the top and the detailed index further down: the
v0.11.0 release preparation (squashes, the wedge gate, the release audit, the
offload fix, the sweep record), the L3 cycle's decisions and investigation
records, the v0.10.0 cycle, the incidents and the superseded sweeps. The
records that predate the 2026-09-28 freeze were archived into git history
earlier and are indexed there too (`git show f2156de^:HANDOFF.md`).

The rule that keeps the split honest: **a record in the archive says what the
branch's authors believed at the time, and no number in it may be quoted as a
measurement of the current code, compared against a Soak result, or used to
gate anything.** The live numbers are
[the release sweep record](benches/records/results-bench-v0.11.0.json), whose
method's home is [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md).
