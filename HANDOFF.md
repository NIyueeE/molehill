# HANDOFF: the current state, and what to do next

This is the working document for whoever picks this repository up: what the tree
is, what has been measured **on it**, what is still open, and which designs are
decided. It is deliberately short. The research record — every round of
investigation, every superseded conclusion, every negative result with its
reasoning — lives in [`HANDOFF-archive.md`](HANDOFF-archive.md), and nothing in
that file describes the current tree unless this one says so.

Read `AGENTS.md` first for the rules; read this for the state.

---

## 1. Current state

| fact | value |
|---|---|
| branch | `feat/v1.0.0` (never tagged; no release has been cut) |
| version | `Cargo.toml` `1.0.0` |
| wire dialect | **6.0**, unreleased; `SUPPORTED_PROTO_VERSIONS` is 6.0 alone |
| carrier default | `mhd`, with `Carrier::{Tcp, Mhd}` and the `"mhd"` wire tag unchanged |
| gates | `just check`, `just bench gate`, `just interop`, `just l3-accept` (§7 has the evidence and dates) |

The 1.0.0 line exists to make **mhd the carrier a user should want by default**,
not merely one that passes a gate. Priorities are fixed:
**latency > throughput > memory > processor**. Nothing about the configuration
model moves: no key is added, removed or renamed, and no default changes.

---

## 2. Decision and invariants

The goal, restated once: a new visitor connection over mhd must cost what a TCP
tunnel costs. Today it does not — see §3 and §4.1.

Binding constraints, all still in force:

- **Configuration is frozen**: no key added, removed or renamed; no default or
  semantic change. `src/config/` may only take wording fixes that match `mhd`.
- **Wire changes go only into dialect 6.0**, which is unreleased; `just interop`
  proves a 6.0 peer and an older dialect refuse each other in both directions.
  No two tags are compatible; a dialect is `major.minor`.
- `Carrier::{Tcp, Mhd}`, the `"mhd"` wire tag, the `unsafe` rules, the permission
  boundary, TCP fallback, the L3/UDP forwarding semantics, the log budget
  (`tests/log_budget_test.rs`) and the serial test convention are all fixed.
- **Never create or push a release tag.** Only a human asks for that; a release
  record is written only when every gate in §7 passes.
- A change that does not beat its own gate is **reverted whole**, with its
  measurement kept. More complexity is not more advanced.

---

## 3. Measured baseline

All numbers below are one run of the `sweep` profile on a freshly built binary,
one round per arm, five arms, 83 samples — `just bench gate` **PASS** (§7). Treat
them as the baseline for any structural change, not as a promise about a
different host.

### 3.1 The clean stages, against the peers (p99, lower is better)

| arm | `timeline[clean]` | `timeline[clean#2]` | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| **molehill (mhd)** | **22.505 ms** | **23.08 ms** | the subject |
| rathole | 2.063 ms | — | TCP tunnel, same model, upstream lineage |
| frp | 2.377 ms | — | TCP tunnel |
| l3 | 3.475 ms | — | userspace L3 tunnel, same repository |
| nps | 101.388 ms | — | TCP tunnel (also fails capacity, §3.3) |

molehill's own row: **7.57 Gbit/s, 0.0 % errors** on `clean`; `clean#2` 23.08 ms
with the same zero errors. Both stages are inside the 50 ms SLO **on their own**
— neither is averaged, and no warm-up stage was added.

The gap this document exists for: a TCP tunnel opens a visitor in **2–3.5 ms**;
mhd takes **22.5 ms**. Roughly ten times, on the cheapest path there is.

### 3.2 The shaped stages (molehill, p99)

| stage | p99 |
|---|---|
| `rtt100` | 402.9 ms |
| `loss1` | 1058.1 ms |
| `loss5` | 1464.3 ms |
| `rate100` | 103.1 ms |
| `rate20` | 184.0 ms |
| `jitter` | 109.9 ms |

Each stage is judged alone. `loss5` and `rate20` are the two the earlier cycle
spent longest on; both are far from the clean floor and neither is improvable by
touching that floor.

### 3.3 Capacity

`molehill sustained 8 of 8 streams`; L1–L8 read 3.1–24.5 ms and the ramp reaches
eight. The same run gives l3, frp and rathole 8 of 8, and **nps 0 of 8** — the
peer fails its own capacity, which is worth knowing before quoting it as a
comparison.

### 3.4 What has *not* been measured on this tree

- **bulk-n against a baseline.** The gate only judges the regression half when it
  is given `--baseline`; that has not been run on this tree. The objective's
  "within 15 %" is therefore **unproven**, not met.
- **`churn-16` and `rr-16` across the reconnect/reuse paths** — the two scenarios
  that would show what a reused connection costs, as opposed to a new one.
- **`MOLEHILL_DATA_CARRIER=tcp` as a matched A/B arm.** The peer arms above are
  TCP tunnels from other projects; the in-tree TCP carrier under the *same*
  binary, same method, same round has not been run.

---

## 4. Open problems

Each is written as symptom → what is unknown → the next experiment → the
pre-registered pass and rollback. **The pass and rollback criteria are fixed
before the experiment runs**; a run that changes them afterwards is not evidence.

### 4.1 A visitor pays for a Noise handshake that TCP does not

- **Symptom.** Clean p99 22.5 ms against 2–3.5 ms for the TCP peers (§3.1), and
  the earlier cycle measured `open_us` p90 45.8 ms / max 101.5 ms on individual
  opens — a per-stream tail, not a throughput problem.
- **A hypothesis that must be tested before the handshake is blamed.** A Noise KK
  over loopback costs roughly one round trip, on the order of 0.1 ms — it cannot
  by itself produce a **20 ms** median. The measured opening median was 20.18 ms,
  and this crate carries `MIN_RTO_SMALL_FLIGHT = 20 ms` and
  `SMALL_FLIGHT_INITIAL_RTO = 20 ms` on exactly this path. A number matching a
  constant is a reason to look, not a conclusion (the archive has a section on
  that mistake), so the first experiment is **A0**: timestamp the first opening
  packet's post and its acknowledgement, and measure the interval. If it clusters
  at the small-flight floor, the tail is an **RTO wait**, not a handshake, and A
  below would buy far less than this document assumed.
- **Unknown.** How much of that is the per-visitor KK handshake versus the
  channel registration around it. The instrument that answers it (an end-to-end
  timeline through `accept → request → pool open → first opening packet → Noise
  reply → channel registered → first echoed byte`) does not exist yet.
- **Next experiment.** **A0** (the small-flight RTO interval, one constant, one
  A/B) and then Phase A below: derive per-stream keys from a **lane-level** root
  instead of running a handshake per visitor. A0 is cheap and is done first
  because it can invalidate A's premise.
- **Pass.** `churn-16` p99 moves toward the peers' ~2.6 ms; both clean stages
  improve; bulk stays within 15 %; peak RSS does not change class.
- **Rollback.** No gain beyond the run's own noise, or bulk/capacity regression,
  or the design cannot avoid re-introducing record boundaries and partial reads.

### 4.2 Recovery cannot tell a lost packet from a deep queue

- **Symptom.** One timer decides the fate of the whole flight: the oldest data
  packet's age gates every non-opening write, so an 11.9 s parked writer was
  measured with a healthy path, and the same timer has to serve a handshake
  packet and a megabyte of bulk.
- **Unknown.** Whether RACK-style loss detection plus a separate PTO — the split
  MsQuic makes in `core/loss_detection.c` — removes both the age gate and the
  full-flight retransmission storm without reintroducing spurious repairs.
- **Next experiment.** Phase B below.
- **Pass.** A single lost opening recovers at low latency; bulk never re-sends a
  healthy flight; `churn-16`, `rr-16`, both clean stages and `loss1/loss5/rtt100`
  each judged alone; retransmission volume and CPU compared in the same round.
- **Rollback.** Any healthy full-flight retransmission storm, or a first-stage
  throughput drop.

### 4.3 A new stream queues behind bulk

- **Symptom.** `conn.rs` schedules one packet per stream round robin, so a
  44-packet GSO run can belong entirely to mature bulk streams while an opening
  waits its turn.
- **Unknown.** Whether bounded per-class quanta (control/repair/opening,
  new-stream, bulk by byte deficit) move the clean tail without costing single
  stream throughput.
- **Next experiment.** Phase C below.
- **Rollback.** p99 improves while throughput falls; or fairness arguments end up
  starving new streams under an adversary that keeps opening them.

### 4.4 The window only grows, and it grows from a proxy

- **Symptom.** `cwnd` never decreases on loss and slow start never returns; the
  flight total is measuring *received* bytes rather than *delivered* ones, which
  this cycle showed is load-bearing: freeing it on what the peer holds made the
  transfer four to five times worse.
- **Unknown.** Whether a delivery-rate/BDP controller (a simplified BBR: startup,
  drain, probe-BW, app-limited sampling) makes the clean stage stable and the
  shaped stages recoverable, and whether its pacing avoids adding a new
  sub-millisecond wait.
- **Next experiment.** Phase D below.
- **Rollback.** Less stable than today's cwnd on a clean host; keep the recovery
  and scheduler work, revert the controller alone.

### 4.5 The runner's summary prints dashes over real data

- **Symptom.** The sweep summary shows `run: -` and `L1..L8: -` for every arm
  while the results file holds those samples; `just bench gate` reads them fine.
- **Unknown.** Which metric the summary selects per cell — a display bug, not a
  data one.
- **Next experiment.** Fix the summary to name the metric it prints, so a future
  reader cannot mistake "no metric chosen" for "no measurement".

### 4.6 Evidence has been lost to its own clean-up

- **Symptom.** A clean-up glob `m[0-9]*-*` matched the result files as well as the
  scratch directories and deleted `~/tmp/m2*.json`, including the aggregate of the
  gate-passing sweep (§7). The raw per-sample artefacts of that run survive under
  `~/tmp/bench-20261105-230248/`, and the gate output is quoted here.
- **Rule for next time.** Clean up by **directory type** (`bench-<date>-<time>/`,
  `m<round>-<topic>/`), list what will be deleted and count it first, and keep
  result JSONs in a directory that no clean-up pattern covers.

## 5. Active architecture decisions

Approved and ordered; **none of A–D is implemented yet**. Each is a separate
commit with its own A/B and its own revert.

**A. Lane-root key derivation** (removes the per-visitor handshake). One Noise
session per lane at establishment; every mhd stream derives its own key and nonce
from `(lane handshake hash, direction, stream id)`. No second record layer, no
yamux on top, no per-stream handshake. Keys and nonces are never reused across
streams or directions; a rebuilt lane gets a fresh root and rejects replays.

**B. RACK + PTO** (splits recovery from congestion). A RACK deadline from
packets with later acknowledgement evidence, a PTO deadline from the newest
ack-eliciting packet with variance and backoff, and a dead-peer decision from
actual silence. Delete the global age gate; keep a bounded probe exemption for
openings.

**C. Priority scheduling** (openings do not queue behind bulk). Bounded quanta
per class, byte-deficit round robin inside bulk, and GSO only over packets
already decided.

**D. Delivery-rate controller** (a window that can shrink). Simplified BBR with
app-limited sampling; loss is repaired, not treated as proof of capacity loss.

Memory and CPU work is **phase 6**: it may not preempt A–D, and it is judged on
`rss_peak_mib` and `cpu_s_per_gbit` against a same-round A/A.

**Order.** A0 (the small-flight RTO interval) → A → B → C → D, with the
end-to-end timeline instrument from §4.1 built before A so that A is judged by
attribution and not by a single number.

**Reading list for B–D.** Four implementations are checked out under
`~/tmp/mhd-references/`; each is cited where the plan uses it:

| project | file | what to take |
|---|---|---|
| msquic | `src/core/loss_detection.c` | the RACK / PTO split, and what each is allowed to declare lost |
| msquic | `src/core/bbr.c` | delivery-rate filter, app-limited sampling |
| quic-go | `internal/ackhandler/received_packet_tracker.go` | which packets force an immediate acknowledgement |
| quinn | `quinn-proto/src/connection/pacing.rs` | token-bucket pacing with a bounded burst: capacity is `window × 2 ms / rtt`, clamped to 10 ms of traffic — the shape §5.D needs |
| quiche | `quiche/src/ack.rs` | range-based acknowledgement instead of a fixed-width bitmap |

---

## 6. Negative results: do not retry these blind

Every row was measured on this repository and reverted. The reasoning lives in
`HANDOFF-archive.md`; this is the index a future experiment should check before
spending a day.

| # | attempt | measured result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Remove the pinned cumulative watermark (make number zero arrive) | mechanism fixed and *proved* (watermark advances to thousands); **3/12** integration runs against a 13/24 baseline — worse |
| 2 | Repair the frontier range on its own clock | 4/12; gated to the closed-window state: **0/12**, the worst result recorded |
| 3 | Widen the acknowledgement bitmap 64 → 512 numbers | 5/12, plus 56 bytes on every packet — reverted |
| 4 | Separate "held" from "delivered" so the peer can free flight | **1/12**; the flight total is load-bearing backpressure |
| 5 | Declare stale records lost on the acknowledgement path | neutral (7/12); the premise was wrong — in a deep flight every record is "old" |
| 6 | Post a lane's first data packet twice | with the condition fixed, 3/12 |
| 7 | `SEND_RUN` 8 or 96 instead of 44 | 5 530 and 7 853 slow opens, stage medians 2.5 → 13 ms |
| 8 | `AckSet::AHEAD` 16 384 | 4/8 against 5/8 |
| 9 | Round-robin or laggard-named byte prefix | 2/8 and 6/12 against 5/8 and 7/12 |
| 10 | Decoupled echo in the test harness | 6/12 — the harness was never the cause |
| 11 | Per-visitor Noise record layer, mux-over-mhd, more lanes / window / threads, static warm pool | rejected earlier; reasoning in the archive |

One row is **not** in this table because it worked: the striped group's reorder
deadline was **2 s**, shorter than an 11.9 s carrier stall, so the reader failed
the group before the transport could finish. Thirty seconds gives **11/12**
integration runs against 13/24. That is the only structural change this cycle
that moved a number, and it moved the *bulk* stall, not the clean tail.

## 7. Environment and reproduction

**Tools and entry points**

- `just check` — the full chain (fmt, machete, ruff, pyright, bench selfcheck,
  clippy twice, serial tests, docs, secrets).
- `just bench doctor` — **run this first after any container restart.** The
  release binary survives in `target/` while source mtimes do not, so a stale
  build silently measures the previous tree: one `cargo build --release` turned a
  91.98 ms "failure" into a 22.50 ms pass.
- `sudo -n env MOLEHILL_MHD_STATS=1 just bench run --profile sweep --out ~/tmp/<name>.json --force`
  — the full sweep, five arms, roughly two hours at scale 1. `just bench gate
  <file>` judges it; add `--baseline <record>` for the regression half.
- `just interop`, `just l3-accept` — dialect refusal and the L3 acceptance run.

**Gate evidence on this tree**

| gate | result |
|---|---|
| `just bench gate ~/tmp/m24-sweep.json` | **PASS** — coverage 83 triples, endpoint 57 samples, SLO 4 clean cells, drowned 0, drift checked, capacity 8/8 (molehill, l3, frp, rathole) and 0/8 (nps). Revision `v0.11.2-592-gff0bae7`, fingerprint `1421e66cb2be72f0`. **That aggregate file was deleted by the §4.6 clean-up**; the run's raw per-sample artefacts survive under `~/tmp/bench-20261105-230248/` (48 series files, 146 raw iperf3 artefacts), and the gate output above is the one this document quotes. |
| `just check` | green after the consolidation commit that carries this file |
| `just interop` | last green earlier in this cycle, at an ancestor commit — **re-run before any release** |
| `just l3-accept` | last green earlier in this cycle, at an ancestor commit — **re-run before any release** |

**Host and harness traps** (each cost real time this cycle)

- **Fixed ports.** The integration test binds 2333/2334. A killed test leaves its
  binary alive holding them, and every later run then fails at startup with
  "connection refused", which reads like a product failure. Check
  `ss -ltn | grep :2333` and `pgrep -af 'deps/integration_test-'` before a batch.
- **`pkill` self-match.** A pattern that appears in the loop's own command line
  kills the loop. Match the child only (`target/debug/deps/integration_test-<hash>`).
- **Network namespaces.** A bench that dies leaves `mhbvis`/`mhbsrv`/`mhbcli`
  behind; delete them before the next run, and never delete one while a bench is
  still running — that is how one sweep was destroyed.
- **Container restarts.** The container is recreated between sessions: `/tmp` is
  wiped, load averages reset, and a sweep running under `/tmp` dies with it.
  Artifacts and evidence go to `~/tmp`.
- **Measurement discipline.** A twelve-run binary comparison resolves about 45
  points; eight runs resolve nothing. Per-round `A/A` gives the noise floor, and
  a difference inside it is not a result. Two of this cycle's three "losses" were
  population mistakes (window versus lifetime counters, one direction subtracted
  from its opposite) — name the convention in the field name, as the window line
  now does (`*_per_s` versus `*_total`).
