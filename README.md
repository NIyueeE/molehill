molehill, like [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) and [ngrok](https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok), can help to expose the service on the device behind the NAT to the Internet, via a server with a public IP.

## Features

- **High Performance** Much higher throughput can be achieved than frp, and more stable when handling a large volume of connections.
- **Low Resource Consumption** Consumes much fewer memory than similar tools. [The binary can be](docs/build-guide.md) **as small as ~500KiB** to fit the constraints of devices, like embedded devices as routers.
- **Security** Tokens of services are mandatory and service-wise. The server and clients are responsible for their own configs. With the optional Noise Protocol, encryption can be configured at ease. No need to create a self-signed certificate! TLS is also supported.
- **Hot Reload** Services can be added or removed dynamically by hot-reloading the configuration file. HTTP API is WIP.

## Quickstart

A full-powered `molehill` can be obtained from the [release](https://github.com/NIyueeE/molehill/releases) page. Or [build from source](docs/build-guide.md) **for other platforms and minimizing the binary**.

The usage of `molehill` is very similar to frp. If you have experience with the latter, then the configuration is very easy for you. The only difference is that configuration of a service is split into the client side and the server side, and a token is mandatory.

To use `molehill`, you need a server with a public IP, and a device behind the NAT, where some services that need to be exposed to the Internet.

Assuming you have a NAS at home behind the NAT, and want to expose its ssh service to the Internet:

1. On the server which has a public IP

Create `server.toml` with the following content and accommodate it to your needs.

```toml
# server.toml
[server]
bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:2333" # `2333` specifies the port that molehill listens for clients

[server.services.my_nas_ssh]
token = "use_a_secret_that_only_you_know" # Token that is used to authenticate the client for the service. Change to an arbitrary value.
bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:5202" # `5202` specifies the port that exposes `my_nas_ssh` to the Internet
```

Then run:

```bash
./molehill server.toml
```

2. On the host which is behind the NAT (your NAS)

Create `client.toml` with the following content and accommodate it to your needs.

```toml
# client.toml
[client]
remote_addr = "myserver.com:2333" # The address of the server. The port must be the same with the port in `server.bind_addr`

[client.services.my_nas_ssh]
token = "use_a_secret_that_only_you_know" # Must be the same with the server to pass the validation
local_addr = "127.0.0.1:22" # The address of the service that needs to be forwarded
```

Then run:

```bash
./molehill client.toml
```

3. Now the client will try to connect to the server `myserver.com` on port `2333`, and any traffic to `myserver.com:5202` will be forwarded to the client's port `22`.

So you can `ssh myserver.com:5202` to ssh to your NAS.

To run `molehill` as a background service on Linux, checkout the
[systemd examples](./examples/systemd) or the
[container examples](./examples/container).

## Configuration

`molehill` determines the running mode (server/client) from the config file
automatically, or you can force it with `--server` / `--client`. The full
configuration specification, logging and tuning options are documented in
[Configuration](./docs/configuration.md). [Example configs](./examples) for
various scenarios are also available.

## Deployment

### Binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the
[release page](https://github.com/NIyueeE/molehill/releases), or
[build from source](./docs/build-guide.md) for other platforms and
minimal-sized binaries.

```bash
./molehill server.toml   # on the public server
./molehill client.toml   # on the device behind NAT
```

### systemd

The [systemd examples](./examples/systemd) show how to run molehill as a
systemd service, both as root and rootless, including multiple instances.

### Container

Official multi-arch images (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) are published to
`ghcr.io/niyueee/molehill`. The image is a single static musl binary on
`scratch` (~8 MiB), runs as non-root UID 1000, and bundles CA certificates
for TLS verification.

```bash
docker run -v /etc/molehill/server.toml:/app/server.toml:ro \
  ghcr.io/niyueee/molehill:latest server.toml
```

The image contains no configuration — mount your config file and pass its
name as the argument. See the [container examples](./examples/container)
for Docker Compose (`compose.yaml` / `compose.bridge.yaml`) and Podman
Quadlet (`molehill-server.container` / `molehill-client.container`)
deployments.
